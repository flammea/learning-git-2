  	<h1>The Cave</h1>
  	<h3>Mumford and Sons</h3>
  		<p>It's empty in the valley of your heart
		The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
		Away from all the fears
		And all the faults you've left behind

		The harvest left no food for you to eat
		You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
		But I have seen the same
		I know the shame in your defeat
		</p>
	  	<p>But I will hold on hope
		And I won't let you choke
		On the noose around your neck

		And I'll find strength in pain
		And I will change my ways
		I'll know my name as it's called again
	  	</p>
