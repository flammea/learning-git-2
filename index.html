  	<h1>The Cave</h1>
  	<h3>Mumford & Sons</h3>
  		<p>It's empty in the valley of your heart
			The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
			Away from all the fears
			And all the faults you've left behind

			The harvest left no food for you to eat
			You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
			But I have seen the same
			I know the shame in your defeat
		</p>
