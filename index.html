  		<p>It's empty in the valley of your heart<br>
		The sun, it rises slowly as you walk<br>
		Away from all the fears<br>
		And all the faults you've left behind<br><br>

		The harvest left no food for you to eat<br>
		You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see<br>
		But I have seen the same<br>
		I know the shame in your defeat
		</p>
	  	<p>But I will hold on hope<br>
		And I won't let you choke<br>
		On the noose around your neck<br><br>

		And I'll find strength in pain<br>
		And I will change my ways<br>
		I'll know my name as it's called again
	  	</p>
	  	<p>Cause I have other things to fill my time<br>
		You take what is yours and I'll take mine<br>
		Now let me at the truth<br>
		Which will refresh my broken mind<br><br>

		So tie me to a post and block my ears<br>
		I can see widows and orphans through my tears<br>
		I know my call despite my faults<br>
		And despite my growing fears</p>
